## About

Power Simulator is a 3 part project and investigation which aims to create a simulation on how energy is used in a particular household.

Part 1: PowerUsageLauncher
    
   PowerUsageLauncher is a simple terminal based UI and graph application which outputs the energy usage of a single house hold based on the time of the day:
        - Plots a graph showing the usage during the morning, afternoon, and night time, which allows the users to analyse the trends and patterns on when
          energy is used the most and when it is least used.
        - The application also plots a graph for the total/cumulative usage (meaning the overall usage combined).
        
Part 2: PowerModelLauncher
    
    PowerModelLauncher simulates the electrical usage of different household appliance throughout the day, which allows users to observe which household appliance
    uses the most amount of energy throughout a 24 hour cycle. Currently, the program only reads in pre-made data gathered on different household appliances 
    (my own) and will need to be modified to read in other appliances.
    
    Currently the program is able to:
        - Provide a
