## About

Power Simulator is a 3 part project and investigation which aims to create a simulation on how energy is used in a particular household.

Part 1: PowerUsageLauncher
PowerUsageLauncher is a simple terminal based UI and graph application which outputs the energy usage of a single house hold based on the time of the day. The program plots a graph showing the usage of a house during the morning, afternoon, and night time, which allows the users to analyse the trends and patterns on when energy is used the most and when it is least used. The application also plots a graph for the total/cumulative usage (meaning the overall usage combined).
        
Part 2: PowerModelLauncher
PowerModelLauncher simulates the electrical usage of different household appliance throughout the day, which allows users to observe which household appliance uses the most amount of energy throughout a 24 hour cycle. Currently, the program only reads in pre-made data gathered on different household appliances (my own) and will need to be modified to read in other appliances. Part 2, along with Part 3 is still a WIP but does work as intended, the PowerModelLauncher is able to provide a simple terminal/text based UI that allows the users to interact with the application and displays a moving interactive graph to simulate power usage.

Part 3: PowerSimulatorLauncher
Simlarly to Part 2's program, PowerSimulatorLauncher aims to provide a simulation of the power consumption of different household appliances. However, there are different factors involved such as; how many residents are living in that house and does more people mean more power is used throughout the day? Are people always in the house or are they only present in the household through out a particula time.

## Notes

The project is still very much a WIP and future changes will come to the programs. THe aim of creating an actual formal UI for the program is on the way. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at jadlumagbas@gmail.com
